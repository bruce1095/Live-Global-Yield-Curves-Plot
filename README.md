# Live Global Yield Curves Analysis

## Overview
This project performs an in-depth analysis and visualization of government bond yield curves from various countries around the world. The script fetches live data from the web, processes it, and generates insightful yield curve plots.

## Files
- `yield_curve_analysis.py`: Python script to perform the analysis.
- `yield_curve_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the same analysis for interactive exploration.
- `yield_curve_example.png`: Example plot of a yield curve.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Requirements
- `matplotlib`
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `seaborn`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Live-Global-Yield-Curves-Analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Live-Global-Yield-Curves-Analysis
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python yield_curve_analysis.py
    ```
5. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook yield_curve_analysis.ipynb
    ```
